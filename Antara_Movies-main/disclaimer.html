    <meta name="description" content="The Arabian Camels is a collection of 12,012 uniquely generated digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Each Camel is programmatically generated from over 180 assets with 8 traits, such as expressions, accessories and headwear etc. Arabian
    Camels are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS. Our community will be able to benefit by partaking in our productions and projects, earning, learning, voting, and contributing to the democratisation and
    decentralisation of the transmedia space. Due to enhanced risk mitigation offered through smart contracts, for the first time in history, movie and gaming investors will also be able to benefit from instant and transparent earnings via
    revenue streams on platforms supported by blockchain technology. Each camel holder has ownership and commercial usage rights over their NFT

            <p>
                1. Definitions. “Art” means any art, design, and drawings that may be associated with an NFT that you Own. "NFT" means any blockchain-tracked, non-fungible token, such as those conforming to the ERC-721 standard. “Own” means, with respect to an NFT, an
                NFT that you have purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired from a legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the relevant blockchain. “Extensions” means third party designs that: (i) are intended for use as extensions
                or overlays to the Art, (ii) do not modify the underlying Art, and (iii) can be removed at any time without affecting the underlying Art. “Purchased NFT” means an NFT that you Own. “Third Party IP” means any third party patent rights (including,
                without limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world. 2. Ownership. You acknowledge and
                agree that Creator (or, as applicable, its licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Art, and all intellectual property rights therein. The rights that you have in and to the Art are limited to those described in
                this License. Creator reserves all rights in and to the Art not expressly granted to you in this License. 3. License. a. General Use. Subject to your continued compliance with the terms of this License, Creator grants you a worldwide,
                non-exclusive, non-transferable, to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased NFTs, along with any Extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal and commercial use; (ii)
                as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your NFTs, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner
                can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your NFTs, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each NFT owner’s rights
                to display the Art for their Purchased NFTs to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased NFT leaves the website/application. b. Commercial Use.
                Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, NFT MEDIA BOX grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”).
                Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) NFT MEDIA BOX and Collabrators original IP, characters, stories, names, creations, etc are not for commercial use.
                4. Restrictions. You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without Creator’s express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify the Art for your Purchased NFT in any way, including,
                without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes (your use of Extensions will not constitute a prohibited modification hereunder); (ii) use the Art for your Purchased NFTs to advertise, market, or sell any
                third party product or service; (iii) use the Art for your Purchased NFTs in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to
                constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (iv) use the Art for your Purchased NFTs in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in Section
                3(b) above or solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that
                includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased NFTs, except as expressly permitted in Section 3(b) above; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art
                for your Purchased NFTs; or (vii) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased NFTs for your or any third party’s commercial benefit. To the extent that Art associated with your Purchased NFTs contains Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual
                property from a celebrity, athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree as follows: (w) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license
                and restrictions contained herein; (x) that the Commercial Use license in Section 3(b) above will not apply; (y) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, Creator may need to pass through
                additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art; and (z) to the extent that Creator informs you of such additional restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions
                from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this license. The restriction in Section 4 will survive the expiration or termination of this License. 5. Terms of License. The license granted
                in Section 3 above applies only to the extent that you continue to Own the applicable Purchased NFT. If at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased NFT for any reason, the license granted
                in Section 3 will immediately expire with respect to those NFTs without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for those NFTs. If you exceed the scope of the license grant in Section 3.b without
                entering into a broader license agreement with or obtaining an exemption from Creator, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are in breach of this License; (ii) in addition to any remedies that may be available to Creator at law or in
                equity, the Creator may immediately terminate this License, without the requirement of notice; and (iii) you will be responsible to reimburse Creator for any costs and expenses incurred by Creator during the course of enforcing the terms
                of this License against you.
